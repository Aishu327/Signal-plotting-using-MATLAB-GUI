# Signal-plotting-using-MATLAB-GUI
I have plotted 4 types of signals including Sine signal,Square signal, triangular signal and composite signal by using MATLAB GUI
Signal plotting using MATLAB GUI means creating an interactive graphical interface where a user can visualize signals(waveforms,data points,or mathematical functions)without writing code everytime.Instead of typing commands in MATLAB's command window,the GUI provides buttons,sliders,text boxes and axes to control and display plots.
